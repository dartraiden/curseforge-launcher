# Launcher for standalone CurseForge app

Since the application does not currently support minimizing on startup, the launcher launches the application and automatically closes its window, which causes the CurseForge to be minimized to tray.

1. Install [**standalone** CurseForge app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)
2. Enable "When I close CurseForge..." `Hide CurseForge` option
3. Place the launcher into the CurseForge installation folder (by default `%Program Files%\CurseForge`) next to CurseForge.exe
4. Right-click the launcher, and then click Send To â†’ Desktop (Create shortcut)
5. Place the shortcut to the startup folder (`%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`)
